# Performance Testing Documentation

This document describes the performance testing strategy and results for Reflexa AI Chrome Extension.

## Performance Requirements

Based on the requirements document, the extension must meet the following performance targets:

### Requirement 11.1: Overlay Render Time

- **Target**: < 300ms
- **Description**: The Reflect Mode overlay shall render and display within 300 milliseconds of user activation
- **Test Method**: Performance API measurements during overlay injection

### Requirement 11.2: Animation Frame Rate

- **Target**: 60 FPS
- **Description**: The Breathing Orb animation shall maintain 60 frames per second throughout the entire animation cycle
- **Test Method**: RequestAnimationFrame monitoring over multiple cycles

### Requirement 11.3: Memory Usage

- **Target**: < 150 MB
- **Description**: The Reflexa System shall consume no more than 150 megabytes of memory during normal operation
- **Test Method**: Chrome Performance Memory API measurements

### Requirement 11.4: AI Latency

- **Target**: < 4 seconds
- **Description**: The Background Service Worker shall complete AI summarization requests within 4 seconds for content under 3000 tokens
- **Test Method**: Timed AI operations with various content lengths

### Requirement 11.5: UI Injection Performance

- **Target**: No visible layout shifts
- **Description**: The Content Script shall inject the Reflect Mode UI without causing visible layout shifts or reflows on the host page
- **Test Method**: Layout shift detection and render time measurement

## Test Suite

### Automated Tests

The automated performance test suite is located in `src/test/performance.test.ts` and includes:

1. **Overlay Render Time Tests**
   - Measures DOM creation and injection time
   - Validates render time is under 300ms threshold
   - Tracks multiple renders for consistency

2. **Animation Frame Rate Tests**
   - Monitors FPS during animation cycles
   - Detects frame drops below 60 FPS
   - Validates smooth animation performance

3. **Memory Usage Tests**
   - Tracks JS heap size during operation
   - Validates memory stays under 150MB limit
   - Warns on high memory consumption

4. **AI Latency Tests**
   - Simulates AI processing for various content lengths
   - Validates completion within 4-second timeout
   - Tests timeout handling and retry logic

5. **UI Injection Tests**
   - Measures shadow DOM creation time
   - Validates no layout shifts occur
   - Tests multiple injections for consistency

### Running Automated Tests

```bash
# Run all performance tests
npm run test -- src/test/performance.test.ts

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage -- src/test/performance.test.ts

# Run in watch mode during development
npm run test:watch -- src/test/performance.test.ts
```

## Manual Performance Testing

### Chrome DevTools Performance Profiling

1. **Build the extension**:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Load the extension**:
   - Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Enable "Developer mode"
   - Click "Load unpacked" and select the `dist/` folder

3. **Profile overlay rendering**:
   - Open a test article page
   - Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
   - Go to Performance tab
   - Click Record
   - Wait for dwell threshold and click lotus nudge
   - Stop recording when overlay appears
   - Analyze the flame chart for render time

4. **Monitor animation performance**:
   - Open DevTools > Performance tab
   - Enable "Screenshots" and "Memory"
   - Record while breathing orb is animating
   - Check FPS meter (should show 60 FPS)
   - Look for dropped frames in the timeline

5. **Check memory usage**:
   - Open DevTools > Memory tab
   - Take heap snapshot before reflection
   - Use the extension (create several reflections)
   - Take another heap snapshot
   - Compare memory usage (should be < 150MB)

### Lighthouse Audits

Run Lighthouse audits on the popup and options pages:

1. **Build the extension**:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Load the extension** in Chrome

3. **Audit popup page**:
   - Right-click extension icon and select "Inspect popup"
   - Open Lighthouse tab in DevTools
   - Select "Performance", "Accessibility", "Best Practices"
   - Click "Generate report"
   - Save report to `docs/evaluation/lighthouse-popup.html`

4. **Audit options page**:
   - Right-click extension icon and select "Options"
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Open Lighthouse tab
   - Select "Performance", "Accessibility", "Best Practices"
   - Click "Generate report"
   - Save report to `docs/evaluation/lighthouse-options.html`

### Performance Targets for Lighthouse

- **Performance Score**: > 90
- **First Contentful Paint**: < 1.0s
- **Largest Contentful Paint**: < 2.5s
- **Total Blocking Time**: < 200ms
- **Cumulative Layout Shift**: < 0.1
- **Speed Index**: < 3.0s
- **Time to Interactive**: < 3.5s

## Performance Monitoring in Production

The extension includes a `PerformanceMonitor` utility class that can be used to track performance metrics in production:

```typescript
import { performanceMonitor } from '@/utils/performanceMonitor';

// Measure overlay render time
performanceMonitor.startMeasure('overlay-render');
// ... render overlay ...
performanceMonitor.endMeasure('overlay-render');

// Monitor frame rate
performanceMonitor.startFrameRateMonitoring();
// ... animation runs ...
performanceMonitor.stopFrameRateMonitoring();

// Check memory usage
performanceMonitor.logMemoryUsage();

// Generate report
performanceMonitor.logReport();
```

## Performance Optimization Techniques

### 1. React Optimization

- Use `React.memo()` for components that don't need frequent re-renders (e.g., BreathingOrb)
- Implement `useCallback()` for event handlers to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Use `useMemo()` for expensive calculations

### 2. CSS Animations

- Use CSS animations instead of JavaScript for breathing orb (better performance)
- Leverage GPU acceleration with `transform` and `opacity` properties
- Avoid animating properties that trigger layout (width, height, margin, padding)

### 3. Shadow DOM

- Inject UI into shadow DOM to prevent style conflicts
- Isolate extension styles from host page
- Reduce CSS specificity conflicts

### 4. Virtual Scrolling

- Implement virtual scrolling for large reflection lists in dashboard
- Only render visible items to reduce DOM nodes
- Improve scroll performance with large datasets

### 5. Lazy Loading

- Lazy load audio files only when needed
- Defer non-critical script loading
- Use dynamic imports for large dependencies

### 6. Memory Management

- Clear event listeners when components unmount
- Avoid memory leaks with proper cleanup in useEffect
- Limit stored metrics to prevent unbounded growth

## Troubleshooting Performance Issues

### Slow Overlay Rendering

- Check for large DOM trees in host page
- Verify shadow DOM is being used correctly
- Profile with Chrome DevTools to identify bottlenecks
- Consider reducing initial render complexity

### Low Frame Rates

- Check if `prefers-reduced-motion` is enabled
- Verify CSS animations are GPU-accelerated
- Look for JavaScript blocking the main thread
- Profile with Performance tab to find long tasks

### High Memory Usage

- Check for memory leaks with heap snapshots
- Verify event listeners are being cleaned up
- Look for large arrays or objects being retained
- Consider implementing data pagination

### Slow AI Responses

- Verify content is being truncated to 3000 tokens
- Check network conditions (though AI is local)
- Look for blocking operations before AI calls
- Consider implementing request queuing

## Continuous Performance Monitoring

### CI/CD Integration

Add performance tests to CI pipeline:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/performance.yml
name: Performance Tests

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  performance:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '22'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run test -- src/test/performance.test.ts
```

### Performance Budgets

Set performance budgets to catch regressions:

```json
{
  "budgets": [
    {
      "resourceSizes": [
        { "resourceType": "script", "budget": 300 },
        { "resourceType": "stylesheet", "budget": 50 },
        { "resourceType": "image", "budget": 100 }
      ]
    },
    {
      "timings": [
        { "metric": "interactive", "budget": 3500 },
        { "metric": "first-contentful-paint", "budget": 1000 }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
