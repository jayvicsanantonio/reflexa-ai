# AI Manager Logging Enhancement

## Overview

Added comprehensive logging to all AI manager classes to improve debugging and monitoring capabilities.

## Logging Pattern

Each manager now includes consistent logging with the following pattern:

- **Prefix**: `[ManagerName]` for easy filtering (e.g., `[LanguageDetectorManager]`)
- **Method entry**: Logs when key methods are called with relevant parameters
- **Performance metrics**: Logs execution time for API calls using `performance.now()`
- **State changes**: Logs cache hits/misses, session creation/reuse, availability checks
- **Error details**: Enhanced error logging with context

## Enhanced Managers

### 1. LanguageDetectorManager

**Key logging additions:**

- `checkAvailability()`: API status and availability result
- `detect()`: Text length, cache key, cache hit/miss, detection time, results
- `getDetector()`: Instance creation time
- `clearCache()`: Number of entries cleared
- `destroy()`: Cleanup confirmation

**Example logs:**

```
[LanguageDetectorManager] detect() called with text length: 1234, pageUrl: https://example.com
[LanguageDetectorManager] Cache key: https://example.com
[LanguageDetectorManager] Cache MISS for: https://example.com
[LanguageDetectorManager] Detection completed in 45.23ms, got 3 results
[LanguageDetectorManager] Detected language: English (en) with confidence 0.95
```

### 2. ProofreaderManager

**Key logging additions:**

- `checkAvailability()`: API status and availability result
- `proofread()`: Text length, languages, timeout values, retry attempts
- `createSession()`: Session reuse vs creation, creation time
- `executeProofread()`: API call time, number of corrections found
- `destroy()`: Session cleanup confirmation

**Example logs:**

```
[ProofreaderManager] proofread() called with text length: 500, languages: en
[ProofreaderManager] Creating new session with languages: en
[ProofreaderManager] Created session in 123.45ms
[ProofreaderManager] Proofread completed in 234.56ms, found 3 corrections
```

### 3. RewriterManager

**Key logging additions:**

- `checkAvailability()`: Availability result
- `rewrite()`: Preset, text length, context presence, timeout values
- `createSession()`: Session key, cache hit/miss, creation time, total sessions
- `executeRewrite()`: Tone/length mapping, API call time
- `destroy()`: Number of sessions destroyed

**Example logs:**

```
[RewriterManager] rewrite() called with preset: calm, text length: 300, context: no
[RewriterManager] Mapped preset "calm" to tone: as-is, length: as-is
[RewriterManager] Creating new session: as-is-plain-text-as-is
[RewriterManager] Created session in 98.76ms (total sessions: 1)
[RewriterManager] Rewrite completed in 456.78ms
```

### 4. SummarizerManager

**Key logging additions:**

- `checkAvailability()`: Availability result
- `summarize()`: Format, text length, timeout values, result count
- `createSession()`: Session key, cache hit/miss, force recreate flag, creation time
- `destroy()`: Number of sessions destroyed

**Example logs:**

```
[SummarizerManager] summarize() called with format: bullets, text length: 2000
[SummarizerManager] Creating new session: key-points-markdown-short (forceRecreate: false)
[SummarizerManager] Created session in 145.23ms (total sessions: 1)
[SummarizerManager] Summarization successful, got 3 items
```

### 5. TranslatorManager

**Key logging additions:**

- `checkAvailability()`: Availability result
- `canTranslate()`: Language pair, status, availability result
- `translate()`: Language pair, text length, timeout values, output length
- `createSession()`: Session key, cache hit/miss, session age, creation time
- `destroy()`: Number of sessions destroyed

**Example logs:**

```
[TranslatorManager] translate() called: en -> es, text length: 500
[TranslatorManager] Checking if can translate en -> es
[TranslatorManager] en -> es: available (can translate: true)
[TranslatorManager] Creating new session: en-es
[TranslatorManager] Created session in 234.56ms (total sessions: 1)
[TranslatorManager] Translation successful, output length: 520
```

### 6. WriterManager

**Key logging additions:**

- `checkAvailability()`: Availability result
- `generate()`: Topic, tone, length, context presence, timeout values
- `createSession()`: Session key, cache hit/miss, creation time, total sessions
- `executeGenerate()`: Tone/length mapping, API call time, word count vs target
- `destroy()`: Number of sessions destroyed

**Example logs:**

```
[WriterManager] generate() called with topic: "reflection", tone: calm, length: medium, context: yes
[WriterManager] Mapped tone "calm" -> neutral, length "medium" -> medium
[WriterManager] Creating new session: neutral-plain-text-medium
[WriterManager] Created session in 156.78ms (total sessions: 1)
[WriterManager] Generated draft in 678.90ms: 150 words (target: 100-200)
```

## Benefits

### 1. Debugging

- Quickly identify which manager is having issues
- See exact parameters being passed to methods
- Track API call performance and timeouts
- Understand cache behavior and session reuse

### 2. Performance Monitoring

- Measure API call durations
- Identify slow operations
- Track session creation overhead
- Monitor cache effectiveness

### 3. Troubleshooting

- See retry attempts and their outcomes
- Understand availability check results
- Track session lifecycle (creation, reuse, destruction)
- Identify configuration issues

### 4. Production Monitoring

- Filter logs by manager name using `[ManagerName]` prefix
- Track API usage patterns
- Monitor error rates
- Analyze performance trends

## Usage

### Filtering Logs

Use browser DevTools console filtering:

```
[LanguageDetectorManager]  # Show only language detector logs
[ProofreaderManager]       # Show only proofreader logs
[RewriterManager]          # Show only rewriter logs
[SummarizerManager]        # Show only summarizer logs
[TranslatorManager]        # Show only translator logs
[WriterManager]            # Show only writer logs
```

### Performance Analysis

Look for timing logs:

```
completed in X.XXms
Created session in X.XXms
```

### Cache Analysis

Look for cache-related logs:

```
Cache HIT
Cache MISS
Reusing cached session
```

## Future Enhancements

- Add log levels (debug, info, warn, error)
- Implement structured logging for better parsing
- Add metrics collection for analytics
- Create dashboard for monitoring AI API usage
