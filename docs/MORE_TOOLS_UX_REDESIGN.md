# More Tools Menu UX/UI Redesign

## Overview

Redesigned the More Tools menu with improved layout, minimalist icons, and universal tools available across all meditation flow screens.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Grid Layout

- Replaced vertical list with a responsive grid layout for better space utilization
- Grid automatically adjusts to fit content with `grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(90px, 1fr))`
- Improved visual hierarchy with clearer section titles

### 2. Tile-Based Design

- Introduced tile components for grid items with:
  - Minimalist icons (emoji-based for consistency)
  - Clear labels
  - Hover effects with subtle elevation
  - Selected state with accent color
  - Disabled state with reduced opacity

### 3. Universal Tools Section

Added tools that are now available in ALL screens (summary and reflection):

#### Ambient Sound Toggle

- Icon: üéµ (unmuted) / üîá (muted)
- Label: "Mute" / "Unmute"
- Allows users to control ambient sound without leaving the meditation flow
- Integrated with existing `AudioManager` functionality

#### Translate Summary

- Icon: üåê
- Label: "Translate"
- Provides quick access to translation in all screens
- Shows loading state (‚è≥) when translating

### 4. Format Options (Summary Screen)

Redesigned with minimalist icons:

- Bullets: `‚Ä¢`
- Paragraph: `¬∂`
- Headline + Bullets: `‚ö°`

### 5. Tone Presets (Reflection Screen)

Now displayed in grid layout with existing icons:

- Calm: üòå
- Concise: ‚Üí
- Empathetic: üíô
- Academic: üéì

### 6. Improved Overflow Handling

- Added `max-height: 70vh` to prevent menu overflow
- Implemented custom scrollbar styling
- Added `overflow-y: auto` for long content
- Backdrop blur for better visual separation

### 7. Enhanced Styling

- Increased menu width to `320px` (min) / `400px` (max)
- Better spacing between sections (16px padding)
- Improved section title styling (smaller, bolder, more spacing)
- Smoother animations and transitions
- Better disabled state handling

## Component Updates

### MoreToolsMenu.tsx

- Added new props: `ambientMuted`, `onToggleAmbient`, `onTranslateSummary`, `isTranslating`
- Restructured JSX to use grid layout for tiles
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing functionality

### MeditationFlowOverlay.tsx

- Passed ambient sound and translate props to MoreToolsMenu
- Connected to existing audio manager and translation functionality

### styles.css

- Added `.reflexa-more-tools__grid` for grid layout
- Added `.reflexa-more-tools__tile` and related classes for tile components
- Enhanced `.reflexa-more-tools__menu` with overflow handling
- Improved scrollbar styling

## Testing

- All 21 existing tests pass
- Added 3 new tests for universal tools:
  - Ambient sound toggle functionality
  - Translate summary functionality
  - Icon state changes based on muted state

## Benefits

1. **Better UX**: Universal tools accessible from any screen
2. **Cleaner Design**: Grid layout reduces visual clutter
3. **No Overflow**: Proper scrolling for long content
4. **Consistent Icons**: Minimalist emoji-based icons throughout
5. **Improved Accessibility**: Clear labels and proper ARIA attributes
6. **Responsive**: Grid adapts to content automatically
