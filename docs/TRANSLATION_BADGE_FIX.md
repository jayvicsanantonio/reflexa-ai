# Translation Badge Fix

## Problem

The language badge wasn't showing up because:

1. `enableTranslation` was set to `false` by default in settings
2. The auto-translate function checks this setting before running
3. Without translation enabled, language detection still runs but the badge condition was too restrictive

## Solution

### 1. Enabled Translation by Default

**Changed in `src/constants/index.ts`:**

```typescript
enableTranslation: true,  // Was: false
```

**Changed in `src/content/index.tsx` (getDefaultSettings):**

```typescript
enableTranslation: true,  // Was: false
```

### 2. Made Badge Always Show When Language is Detected

**Changed in `src/content/components/MeditationFlowOverlay.tsx`:**

- Badge now shows for ALL detected languages (not just foreign ones)
- Adds "(translated)" indicator when content was auto-translated
- This helps with debugging and shows users the feature is working

### 3. Added Debug Logging

Added console.log statements to help debug:

```typescript
console.log('[Badge Debug] languageDetection:', languageDetection);
console.log('[Badge Debug] step:', step);
```

## How to Test

### Test 1: English Article

1. Open any English article
2. Click "Reflect"
3. Wait for breathing phase
4. In Step 1, you should see: **🌐 English** (top-right)

### Test 2: Spanish Article (if you have one)

1. Open a Spanish article
2. Click "Reflect"
3. Wait for breathing phase (translation happens here)
4. In Step 1, you should see: **🌐 Spanish (translated)**
5. Summary should be in English

### Test 3: Check Console

Open DevTools Console and look for:

```
Language detected: { detectedLanguage: 'en', confidence: 0.98, languageName: 'English' }
[Badge Debug] languageDetection: { ... }
[Badge Debug] step: 1
```

## What the Badge Shows

### English Content (No Translation)

```
🌐 English
```

### Foreign Content (Auto-Translated)

```
🌐 Spanish (translated)
```

## Badge Styling

- **Position**: Top-right of summary
- **Style**: Subtle, semi-transparent
- **Hover**: Slightly brighter
- **Size**: Small (11px font)
- **Colors**: Matches zen aesthetic

## Next Steps

If the badge still doesn't show:

1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify language detection is running (check logs)
3. Ensure `languageDetection` prop is being passed to overlay
4. Check if Step 1 is rendering correctly

## Remove Debug Logging (Optional)

Once confirmed working, you can remove these lines from `MeditationFlowOverlay.tsx`:

```typescript
{
  (() => {
    console.log('[Badge Debug] languageDetection:', languageDetection);
    console.log('[Badge Debug] step:', step);
    return null;
  })();
}
```
