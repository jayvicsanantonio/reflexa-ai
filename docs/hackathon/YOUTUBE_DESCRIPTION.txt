Ever finish reading an article and immediately forget what you just read? Yeah, me too. That's why I built Reflexa AI.

This Chrome extension uses ALL 7 of Chrome's Built-in AI APIs to transform passive reading into active reflection. And everything runs 100% locally on your device. No cloud. No tracking. Complete privacy.

üß† WHY THIS MATTERS

You're not lazy. Your brain just isn't wired to remember everything you scroll past. Research shows we forget 90% of what we read within a week. Reflexa AI fixes that by adding one simple step: reflection.

‚ú® HOW IT WORKS

After you've been actively reading for about 10 seconds, a gentle lotus icon appears. Click it, and you enter a calming meditation flow:

1. BREATHE - An 8-second breathing animation while AI processes the article
2. SUMMARY - Three AI-generated bullets (Insight, Surprise, Apply)
3. REFLECT - Two thoughtful questions to deepen your understanding
4. REMEMBER - Your reflections are saved with streak tracking

But here's where it gets really cool...

ü§ñ ALL 7 CHROME AI APIS (First Extension Ever!)

I integrated every single Chrome Built-in AI API powered by Gemini Nano:

‚úì Summarizer API - Generates summaries in 3 different formats
‚úì Writer API - Creates contextual drafts when you're stuck
‚úì Rewriter API - Adjusts your tone (Calm, Concise, Empathetic, Academic)
‚úì Proofreader API - Fixes grammar with side-by-side previews
‚úì Language Detector API - Auto-detects 100+ languages
‚úì Translator API - Translates summaries and reflections
‚úì Prompt API - Intelligent fallback when other APIs aren't available

Each API has proper error handling, timeout management, and graceful degradation. If one fails, it automatically falls back to the next best option.

üéôÔ∏è VOICE INPUT THAT ACTUALLY WORKS

Speak your reflections and watch them transcribe in real-time. The smart part? If you start typing, voice input auto-pauses. Stop typing for 2 seconds, and it resumes. It just works.

üîí PRIVACY YOU CAN VERIFY

I'm serious about privacy. Open Chrome DevTools during the demo and watch: ZERO network requests. Everything happens on your device using Gemini Nano. No data leaves your computer. Ever.

You can literally verify this yourself at 2:10 in the video.

üìä WHAT YOU'LL SEE IN THIS DEMO

0:00 - Lotus nudge appears after reading
0:10 - Breathing meditation phase (while AI works)
0:35 - AI-generated summary with language detection
0:50 - Voice input with real-time transcription
1:05 - AI draft generation (Writer API)
1:15 - Tone adjustment with preview (Rewriter API)
1:20 - Second reflection question
1:35 - Dashboard with streak tracking & statistics
1:55 - AI Status panel (all 7 APIs available)
2:10 - Privacy proof (zero network calls)

üé® DESIGNED FOR CALM, NOT CHAOS

Breathing animations. Ambient audio. Muted colors. Smooth transitions. This isn't another productivity tool that stresses you out. It's designed to feel like a meditation session.

üìà TRACK YOUR GROWTH

Built-in dashboard shows your reflection streak, total reflections, reading vs. reflection time ratio, and lets you export everything to JSON or Markdown.

üåç WORKS EVERYWHERE

Supports 100+ languages with automatic detection. Full keyboard navigation. Screen reader compatible. Reduce motion support. This is accessibility done right.

üí° WHY I BUILT THIS

I was reading 20+ articles a week and remembering nothing. It was frustrating. So I spent months building the tool I wished existed.

The result? A Chrome extension that combines mindfulness practices with cutting-edge on-device AI. No venture capital. No data harvesting. Just a tool that helps you remember what matters.

‚Ä¢ People interested in mindful technology
‚Ä¢ Privacy-conscious users who want local AI
‚Ä¢ Developers curious about Chrome's Built-in AI APIs

üåü WHAT MAKES THIS DIFFERENT?

Most reading tools focus on saving articles for later. Reflexa focuses on processing them now. It's the difference between hoarding books and actually reading them.

Most AI tools send your data to the cloud. Reflexa processes everything locally. It's the difference between privacy theater and actual privacy.

Most productivity tools add stress. Reflexa adds calm. It's the difference between optimization and mindfulness.

üìù THE STORY BEHIND IT

I built this because I was frustrated. I'd read an article, feel like I learned something, and a week later... nothing. It was like pouring water into a leaky bucket.

I tried highlighting. I tried note-taking apps. I tried spaced repetition. Nothing stuck because I wasn't actually processing what I read. I was just consuming.

Then I started practicing mindfulness meditation. Those few minutes of intentional breathing and reflection were transforming how I processed my day. And I thought: what if we could bring that same intentionality to reading?

That's where Reflexa AI was born. Not from a desire to build another productivity tool, but from a genuine need to remember what matters.

I spent months learning Chrome's Built-in AI APIs, building the architecture, designing the meditation flow, and polishing every detail. The breathing animations. The voice input. The fallback systems. The accessibility features. All of it.

And now it's done. A Chrome extension that helps you pause, reflect, and remember. Built solo. Built with care. Built for anyone who's ever felt overwhelmed by information.
