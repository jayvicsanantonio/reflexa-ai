## SCRIPT

### [0:00 - 0:05] OPENING (5 seconds)

**[SCREEN: Article page, lotus icon appears immediately]**

**YOU:**
"Hey! Let me show you Reflexa AI. I'm reading this article, and after a few seconds of active reading, this lotus icon appears."

---

### [0:05 - 0:10] LOTUS INTERACTION (5 seconds)

**[SCREEN: Hover over lotus, it expands to show quick actions]**

**YOU:**
"Hover over it, and you get quick access to your dashboard, AI status, and settings. But let's click Reflect."

---

### [0:10 - 0:18] BREATHING PHASE STARTS (8 seconds)

**[SCREEN: Click Reflect, meditation flow opens with breathing orb]**

**YOU:**
"Now here's where it gets interesting. While this breathing orb guides you through an 8-second cycle, the AI is working behind the scenes."

---

### [0:18 - 0:35] EXPLAIN DURING BREATHING (17 seconds)

**[SCREEN: Breathing orb continues, phrases rotating]**

**YOU:**
"Reflexa AI solves a simple problem. We read dozens of articles every week but forget almost everything. So I built this extension to help you pause, reflect, and actually remember what you read. And here's the cool part: it uses all 7 of Chrome's Built-in AI APIs, running entirely on your device. No cloud, no tracking, 100% local."

---

### [0:35 - 0:50] SUMMARY STEP (15 seconds)

**[SCREEN: Auto-advances to summary with 3 bullets and language badge]**

**YOU:**
"The AI just generated this three-bullet summary. Insight, Surprise, and Apply. It also detected the language automatically. And if I click More Tools, I can switch formats or even translate it. But let's move to the reflection questions."

**[SCREEN: Click "More Tools" briefly, then click "Next"]**

---

### [0:50 - 1:20] REFLECTION WITH AI FEATURES (30 seconds)

**[SCREEN: First reflection question appears]**

**YOU:**
"Here's where the magic happens. I can type my thoughts, or..."

**[SCREEN: Click microphone button, speak a short reflection]**

**YOU (speaking into mic):**
"Nano Banana is amazing"

**[SCREEN: Transcription appears in real-time]**

**YOU:**
"Voice input with real-time transcription. Now let me show you the AI features. Click More Tools."

**[SCREEN: Click More Tools, click "Generate Draft"]**

**YOU:**
"Proofread uses the Proofreader API to look and correct erros in grammar, spelling and punctuation."

**[SCREEN: Text appears progressively]**

**YOU:**
"Now let's try tone adjustment. I'll select Concise."

**[SCREEN: Click More Tools, select Concise tone]**

**YOU:**
"The Rewriter API shows me a preview. Original versus rewritten. I can accept or discard."

**[SCREEN: Click Accept, then click Next]**

---

### [1:20 - 1:35] SECOND REFLECTION (15 seconds)

**[SCREEN: Second reflection question appears]**

**YOU:**
"Second question works the same way. Voice input, AI drafts, tone adjustment, proofreading. All independent. Let me quickly type something and save."

**[SCREEN: Type a short reflection, click Save]**

---

### [1:35 - 1:55] DASHBOARD (20 seconds)

**[SCREEN: Overlay closes, click Reflexa AI icon, dashboard opens]**

**YOU:**
"And here's your dashboard. Streak counter, statistics, and all your reflections. Each one shows the summary and your thoughts. You can export to JSON or Markdown, delete reflections, or click the title to go back to the article."

**[SCREEN: Scroll through dashboard, hover over export button]**

---

### [1:55 - 2:10] AI STATUS (15 seconds)

**[SCREEN: Click AI Status button]**

**YOU:**
"This is the AI Status panel. All 7 Chrome Built-in AI APIs. Summarizer, Writer, Rewriter, Proofreader, Language Detector, Translator, and Prompt API. All available, all running locally."

**[SCREEN: Show all green checkmarks]**

---

### [2:10 - 2:25] PRIVACY VERIFICATION (15 seconds)

**[SCREEN: Open DevTools, show Network tab with zero requests]**

**YOU:**
"And here's the proof. DevTools Network tab. Zero network requests during the entire flow. Everything happened on your device. Complete privacy."

**[SCREEN: Highlight empty network log]**

---

### [2:25 - 2:30] CLOSING (5 seconds)

**[SCREEN: Close DevTools, show dashboard one more time]**

**YOU:**
"Reflexa AI. Pause, reflect, remember. Built with all 7 Chrome Built-in AI APIs. Thanks for watching!"

**[SCREEN: Fade to Reflexa AI logo or tagline]**

## TIPS FOR RECORDING

2. **Keep moving** - Don't linger too long on any screen
3. **Show, don't tell** - Let the UI speak for itself when possible
4. **Emphasize the "all 7 APIs" point** - This is your differentiator
5. **The privacy verification is powerful** - Make sure it's clear
6. **Practice the timing** - The breathing phase is perfect for your explanation
7. **Use cursor movements** - Guide the viewer's eye to important elements
8. **Keep energy up** - 2:30 goes by fast, maintain momentum

## BACKUP SCRIPT (If Running Long)

If you're running over time, you can cut:

- The second reflection demo (save 15 seconds)
- The export button hover (save 3 seconds)
- Shorten the AI Status section (save 5 seconds)

This gives you a 2:07 version if needed.

## ALTERNATIVE OPENING (If You Want to Start with Context)

**[0:00 - 0:10] Alternative Opening**

**YOU:**
"We read dozens of articles every week but forget almost everything. Reflexa AI fixes that. Watch this. I'm reading an article, and after a few seconds, this lotus icon appears. Let me click it."

Then continue from [0:10] with the breathing phase.

This version front-loads the problem/solution but takes 10 seconds instead of 5.
