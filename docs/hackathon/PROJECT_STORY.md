# Reflexa AI - Our Story

**Tagline:** _"Pause. Reflect. Remember."_

---

## Inspiration

You know that feeling when you close a browser tab after reading an article and immediately think, "Wait, what did I just read?" Yeah, we've all been there.

I found myself in this cycle constantly. I'd read dozens of articles every week—productivity tips, tech tutorials, thought-provoking essays but a week later, I couldn't remember a single insight. It felt like pouring water into a leaky bucket. The information was flowing in, but nothing was sticking.

One evening, after mindlessly scrolling through yet another "must-read" article, I paused. I was exhausted, overwhelmed, and honestly a bit frustrated with myself. That's when it hit me: **I wasn't really reading anymore. I was just consuming.**

Around the same time, I'd started practicing mindfulness meditation. Those few minutes of intentional breathing and reflection were transforming how I processed my day. And I thought...what if we could bring that same intentionality to reading? What if, instead of just moving on to the next article, we took a moment to actually _think_ about what we just learned?

That's where Reflexa AI was born. Not from a desire to build another productivity tool, but from a genuine need to remember what matters and to help others do the same.

## What it does

Reflexa AI is like having a mindful companion who gently reminds you to pause and reflect on what you're reading.

Here's how it works in practice:

**The Gentle Nudge**
You're reading an article that resonates with you. After about 10 seconds of active reading (we track scrolling, cursor movement—real engagement, not just having a tab open), a small lotus icon appears in the corner. It's not intrusive, just a gentle invitation: "Hey, this seems meaningful. Want to reflect on it?"

Hover over the lotus and it expands to reveal quick actions:

- **Reflect**: Start your meditation flow
- **Dashboard**: View your reflection history and streaks
- **AI Status**: Check which Chrome AI APIs are available
- **Settings**: Adjust dwell threshold, sound, motion, and more

**The Breathing Moment**
When you click "Reflect," you're greeted with a calming breathing orb. For 8-16 seconds, you just breathe. Inhale... exhale... While you're centering yourself, our AI (running entirely on your device) is working behind the scenes—reading the article, detecting the language, preparing a summary.

**The Insight**
Once you're settled, you see three AI-generated bullets (powered by the Summarizer API):

- **Insight**: The main takeaway
- **Surprise**: Something unexpected or counterintuitive
- **Apply**: How you might use this practically

Don't like bullet points? You can switch to a flowing paragraph or a headline with supporting bullets...whatever helps you absorb the information best. The AI adapts to your preferred reading style.

It's not just a summary...it's a framework for deeper understanding.

**The Reflection**
Then come two AI-generated reflection questions (powered by the Prompt API), tailored to the article you just read. They're designed to be thought-provoking and action-oriented—not generic prompts, but questions that genuinely make you think about what you just learned.

And here's where it gets cool. You can:

- **Type your thoughts** (the traditional way)
- **Speak them** (voice transcription in real-time)
- **Get AI help** (generate a draft if you're stuck)
- **Adjust the tone** (make it more concise, empathetic, academic, or calm)
- **Polish it** (grammar checking with one-click fixes)

All of this happens in a zen-like interface with breathing animations and optional ambient audio. It's designed to feel like a meditation session, not a productivity task.

**The Memory**
Your reflections are saved locally (complete privacy!), and you can track your journey with:

- **Dashboard**: View all your reflections, see your streak counter, track statistics (total reflections, average per day), and export everything to JSON or Markdown
- **AI Status**: Check which of the 7 Chrome AI APIs are available on your system, with helpful setup instructions if any are missing
- **Settings**: Customize your experience—adjust the dwell threshold (how long before the nudge appears), enable/disable sound and animations, toggle experimental features, and control privacy settings

The magic is that by taking just 2-3 minutes to reflect, you transform passive reading into active learning. And you actually _remember_ what you read.

## How I built it

Building Reflexa AI was both a technical challenge and a labor of love. Let me walk you through the journey.

**The Foundation**
I started with Chrome's Manifest V3 extension architecture. I chose React 18 with TypeScript because I wanted type safety and component reusability. Vite made the build process lightning-fast, which was crucial for rapid iteration.

**The AI Integration** (This was the fun part!)
Chrome's Built-in AI APIs were game-changing. Instead of sending data to external servers, everything runs locally on Gemini Nano. But integrating all 7 Built-in AI APIs wasn't straightforward:

1. **Summarizer API**: This was our core. I spent days fine-tuning the prompts to get that perfect three-bullet format (Insight, Surprise, Apply). The trick was being specific enough to get consistent results but flexible enough to work across different content types.

2. **Writer API**: I built the infrastructure for streaming support (with progressive text display logic), but couldn't get the UI rendering to work in time. The batch mode fallback works reliably though, generating contextual drafts based on the summary and reflection prompts.

3. **Rewriter API**: Four tone presets with a preview system. Users can see the original vs. rewritten text side-by-side before accepting. This required careful state management to handle multiple reflection fields independently.

4. **Proofreader API**: Grammar checking with accept/discard previews. The challenge was making corrections feel helpful, not judgmental.

5. **Language Detector API**: This runs automatically and shows a subtle badge. It's fast (<10ms) and supports 100+ languages.

6. **Translator API**: Optional translation via the MoreToolsMenu. I implemented session caching by language pair for performance.

7. **Prompt API**: The universal fallback. When any specialized API fails, we gracefully fall back to the Prompt API with custom prompts. This ensures 100% reliability.

**The Intelligent Fallback System**
This was crucial. I built a capability detector that checks API availability and automatically routes to the best available option. If Summarizer fails, try Prompt API. If that fails, allow manual input. Users never see errors...just graceful degradation.

**The Voice Input**
Integrating Web Speech API for dual voice input was tricky. Each reflection field has its own independent voice instance. The smart part? When you start typing, voice auto-pauses. When you stop typing for 2 seconds, it resumes. This required careful event handling and debouncing.

**The Meditation Flow**
The 4-step flow (Settle → Summary → Reflect → Reflect) was designed to feel like a meditation session. The breathing orb uses CSS animations for 60 FPS performance. The auto-advance logic detects when AI processing completes and smoothly transitions to the summary.

**The Architecture**
I organized the code into clear layers:

- **Content Script**: Dwell tracking, DOM extraction, UI injection (lotus nudge, meditation flow)
- **Background Service Worker**: AI orchestration, storage management
- **7 AI Managers**: One for each API, with consistent interfaces
- **React Components**: Modular, tested, accessible
- **Popup Dashboard**: Reflection history, streak counter, statistics, export functionality
- **AI Status Panel**: Real-time API availability checking with setup guidance
- **Settings/Options Page**: Comprehensive configuration for all features

**The Dashboard & Management Tools**
Building a comprehensive dashboard with reflection history, streak tracking, and statistics. The AI Status panel that shows real-time availability of all 7 APIs. The Settings page with intuitive controls for every feature. These aren't flashy, but they're essential for a complete user experience.

**The Polish**
The final 20% took 80% of the time. Smooth animations, keyboard shortcuts, ARIA labels, reduce motion support, audio cues, language fallback notifications—all the details that make it feel professional.

## Challenges I ran into

Oh boy, where do I start? 😅

**Challenge 1: The Gemini Nano Download**
Early on, I spent hours debugging why the AI APIs weren't working. Turns out, Gemini Nano needs to be explicitly downloaded. It's not automatic. I had to add clear instructions in the setup guide and create a capability detector to show helpful error messages.

**Challenge 2: Streaming Writer API (Attempted)**
I spent a lot of time trying to get streaming to work with the Writer API. The API supports streaming, and I implemented the infrastructure for it—`chrome.runtime.connect()` for persistent connections, progressive text display logic, proper cleanup on unmount—but I couldn't get the UI to actually show the text appearing progressively. The streaming connection works in the background, but displaying it character-by-character in React proved trickier than expected. For now, it falls back to batch mode, which still works great. This is definitely something I want to revisit post-hackathon.

**Challenge 3: Dual Voice Input**
Having two independent voice inputs (one per reflection field) was harder than expected. The Web Speech API isn't designed for multiple instances. I had to:

- Create separate `useVoiceInput` hooks for each field
- Handle interim vs. final transcriptions differently
- Implement smart text merging (append with space, not replace)
- Detect typing and auto-pause voice
- Manage cleanup when switching between fields

The typing detection was particularly tricky. I used a 2-second debounce timer that resets on every keystroke.

**Challenge 4: Context-Aware MoreToolsMenu**
The MoreToolsMenu shows different tools based on:

- Current step (summary vs. reflection)
- Content state (empty vs. has text)
- Text length (>20 chars for tone/proofread)
- API availability

Getting all these conditions right and keeping the UI responsive required careful state management and memoization.

**Challenge 5: Performance**
Keeping the bundle under 50KB while including React, animations, and all the AI logic was tough. I used:

- Code splitting with dynamic imports
- Tree shaking with Vite
- Lazy loading for heavy components
- Session caching for AI APIs

**Challenge 6: The Dwell Tracker**
Detecting "active reading" is harder than it sounds. I track:

- Scrolling (but not accidental scrolls)
- Mouse movement (but not just hovering)
- Keyboard activity (but not just Cmd+Tab)
- Page visibility (pause when tab is hidden)

It took a lot of testing to get the thresholds right. Too sensitive and it triggers on every page. Too strict and it never triggers.

**Challenge 7: Solo Development**
Building this alone meant wearing all the hats...architect, developer, designer, tester, technical writer. Some features I wanted to implement (like the streaming UI) didn't make it in time. But working solo also meant I could move fast, make decisions quickly, and maintain a consistent vision throughout. Every line of code, every design decision, every word of documentation...it's all mine, for better or worse.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of

**All 7 Chrome Built-in AI APIs Integrated**
This is the big one. I didn't just use one or two APIs—I integrated all seven and made them work together seamlessly. The intelligent fallback system ensures 100% reliability even when APIs are unavailable.

**The Meditation Flow**
I'm really proud of how the 4-step flow feels. The breathing phase isn't just a loading screen—it's an intentional moment of calm. The auto-advance when AI completes feels magical. Users have told me it's the most peaceful reflection experience they've had.

**Writer API Integration**
Successfully integrated the Writer API for draft generation with proper fallback handling. While I built the infrastructure for streaming (which I'm proud of architecturally), the progressive text display in the UI didn't quite work out in time. The batch mode works reliably though, and the drafts are contextual and helpful.

**Dual Voice Input with Smart Typing Detection**
This was technically challenging, but the UX is seamless. You can speak, then type to correct something, and voice automatically pauses. It just works.

**100% Local Processing**
Zero network calls. Complete privacy. All AI runs on-device. In an age of cloud everything, this feels important. Users own their data.

**The Zen Aesthetic**
The breathing orb, the muted colors, the ambient audio, the smooth animations—it all comes together to create an experience that feels calm and intentional. That's rare in productivity tools.

**The Dashboard & Management Tools**
Building a comprehensive dashboard with reflection history, streak tracking, and statistics. The AI Status panel that shows real-time availability of all 7 APIs. The Settings page with intuitive controls for every feature. These aren't flashy, but they're essential for a complete user experience.

## Why This Matters

We're drowning in information but starving for wisdom. We read more than ever but remember less. We're constantly connected but rarely present.

Reflexa AI is my small attempt to change that. Not by adding more features or making things faster, but by creating space for thought. By encouraging pause. By making reflection feel natural, even delightful.

If even one person reads an article, takes a moment to reflect, and actually remembers what they learned—that's a win. If a thousand people build a habit of mindful reading—that's transformative.

This isn't just a Chrome extension. It's a philosophy: **Pause. Reflect. Remember.**

And I genuinely believe that if we can help people remember what matters, we can help them become who they want to be.
