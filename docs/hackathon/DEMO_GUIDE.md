## 🎤 Q&A Preparation

### Expected Questions

**Q: How does the fallback system work?**
A: Each API has a fallback chain: Specialized API → Prompt API → Manual mode. For example, summarization tries Summarizer API first, falls back to Prompt API with custom prompt, and finally allows manual input if both fail.

**Q: What happens if Gemini Nano isn't available?**
A: The extension gracefully degrades. Core features (dwell tracking, manual reflection) still work. AI features show "unavailable" status with helpful setup instructions.

**Q: How do you ensure privacy?**
A: All AI processing happens on-device using Chrome's Built-in AI APIs. We can demonstrate zero network calls in Chrome DevTools. No data is ever sent to external servers.

**Q: What's the performance impact?**
A: Minimal. Extension bundle is <50KB. AI operations average <100ms. Memory usage <30MB. All processing is asynchronous and non-blocking.

**Q: How is this different from Readwise/Pocket?**
A: Those tools save content for later. Reflexa processes content in the moment during active reading, using AI to guide reflection. It's about understanding, not just collecting.

**Q: What's your monetization strategy?**
A: Freemium model. Free tier includes unlimited reflections with all AI features. Premium ($4.99/month) adds unlimited history, advanced analytics, and custom prompts.

**Q: Can this work offline?**
A: Yes! Once Gemini Nano is downloaded, all AI features work completely offline. No internet connection required.

**Q: What about mobile?**
A: Currently Chrome extension only. Mobile app (React Native) is on the roadmap for Q1 2026.
