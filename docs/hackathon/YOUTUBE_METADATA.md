## DESCRIPTION

### Full Description (Copy-Paste Ready)

```
Ever finish reading an article and immediately forget what you just read? Yeah, me too. That's why I built Reflexa AI.

This Chrome extension uses ALL 7 of Chrome's Built-in AI APIs to transform passive reading into active reflection. And everything runs 100% locally on your device. No cloud. No tracking. Complete privacy.

üß† WHY THIS MATTERS
You're not lazy. Your brain just isn't wired to remember everything you scroll past. Research shows we forget 90% of what we read within a week. Reflexa AI fixes that by adding one simple step: reflection.

‚ú® HOW IT WORKS
After you've been actively reading for about 10 seconds, a gentle lotus icon appears. Click it, and you enter a calming meditation flow:

1. BREATHE - An 8-second breathing animation while AI processes the article
2. SUMMARY - Three AI-generated bullets (Insight, Surprise, Apply)
3. REFLECT - Two thoughtful questions to deepen your understanding
4. REMEMBER - Your reflections are saved with streak tracking

But here's where it gets really cool...

ü§ñ ALL 7 CHROME AI APIS (First Extension Ever!)
I integrated every single Chrome Built-in AI API powered by Gemini Nano:

‚úì Summarizer API - Generates summaries in 3 different formats
‚úì Writer API - Creates contextual drafts when you're stuck
‚úì Rewriter API - Adjusts your tone (Calm, Concise, Empathetic, Academic)
‚úì Proofreader API - Fixes grammar with side-by-side previews
‚úì Language Detector API - Auto-detects 100+ languages
‚úì Translator API - Translates summaries and reflections
‚úì Prompt API - Intelligent fallback when other APIs aren't available

Each API has proper error handling, timeout management, and graceful degradation. If one fails, it automatically falls back to the next best option.

üéôÔ∏è VOICE INPUT THAT ACTUALLY WORKS
Speak your reflections and watch them transcribe in real-time. The smart part? If you start typing, voice input auto-pauses. Stop typing for 2 seconds, and it resumes. It just works.

üîí PRIVACY YOU CAN VERIFY
I'm serious about privacy. Open Chrome DevTools during the demo and watch: ZERO network requests. Everything happens on your device using Gemini Nano. No data leaves your computer. Ever.

You can literally verify this yourself at 2:10 in the video.

üìä WHAT YOU'LL SEE IN THIS DEMO
0:00 - Lotus nudge appears after reading
0:10 - Breathing meditation phase (while AI works)
0:35 - AI-generated summary with language detection
0:50 - Voice input with real-time transcription
1:05 - AI draft generation (Writer API)
1:15 - Tone adjustment with preview (Rewriter API)
1:20 - Second reflection question
1:35 - Dashboard with streak tracking & statistics
1:55 - AI Status panel (all 7 APIs available)
2:10 - Privacy proof (zero network calls)

üé® DESIGNED FOR CALM, NOT CHAOS
Breathing animations. Ambient audio. Muted colors. Smooth transitions. This isn't another productivity tool that stresses you out. It's designed to feel like a meditation session.

üìà TRACK YOUR GROWTH
Built-in dashboard shows your reflection streak, total reflections, reading vs. reflection time ratio, and lets you export everything to JSON or Markdown.

üåç WORKS EVERYWHERE
Supports 100+ languages with automatic detection. Full keyboard navigation. Screen reader compatible. Reduce motion support. This is accessibility done right.

üí° WHY I BUILT THIS
I was reading 20+ articles a week and remembering nothing. It was frustrating. So I spent [X weeks/months] building the tool I wished existed.

The result? A Chrome extension that combines mindfulness practices with cutting-edge on-device AI. No venture capital. No data harvesting. Just a tool that helps you remember what matters.

Good luck with the video! The key is to emphasize the "all 7 APIs" angle and the privacy aspect. Those are your differentiators.
