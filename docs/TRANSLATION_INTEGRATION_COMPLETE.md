# Translation Integration Complete ✅

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **Ambient Translation During Breathing Phase**

Translation now happens seamlessly during Step 0 (breathing) so users never feel interrupted.

**Changes in `src/content/index.tsx`:**

- Language detection runs in parallel with summarization
- Auto-translation happens during breathing phase if:
  - Translation is enabled in settings
  - Content is in foreign language
  - Confidence is > 90%
- Translation is cached per page URL (24-hour TTL)

### 2. **Subtle Language Badge**

A minimal, zen-aligned indicator shows detected language in Step 1.

**Changes in `src/content/components/MeditationFlowOverlay.tsx`:**

- Small badge appears top-right of summary
- Only shows if content is in foreign language
- Displays language name with globe icon
- Subtle styling that doesn't disrupt meditation flow

### 3. **Helper Functions**

**Added to `src/content/index.tsx`:**

- `shouldAutoTranslate()` - Determines if translation should happen
- `handleAutoTranslate()` - Performs translation with caching

## User Experience

### Scenario 1: Spanish Article, English User

```
1. User clicks "Reflect" on Spanish article
2. Overlay appears → Step 0: Breathing orb (8s)
   └─ Behind the scenes: Detects Spanish (95% confidence)
   └─ Behind the scenes: Auto-translates to English
3. Step 1: Summary appears in English
   └─ Small badge shows: "🌐 Spanish"
4. User reflects normally, never felt interrupted
```

### Scenario 2: English Article, English User

```
1. User clicks "Reflect" on English article
2. Step 0: Breathing
   └─ Detects English, matches user language
3. Step 1: Summary in English
   └─ No badge shown (not needed)
4. User never sees translation feature
```

### Scenario 3: French Article, Low Confidence

```
1. User clicks "Reflect" on French article
2. Step 0: Breathing
   └─ Detects French (75% confidence)
   └─ Below 90% threshold, no auto-translate
3. Step 1: Summary in French
   └─ Badge shows: "🌐 French"
4. User can manually translate via "More" panel (future)
```

---

## Settings Required

Users need to enable translation in settings:

```typescript
{
  enableTranslation: true,
  preferredTranslationLanguage: 'en',
  // Auto-translate threshold is hardcoded to 0.9 (90%)
}
```

---

## Performance

- **Parallel processing**: Language detection + summarization happen together
- **Caching**: Translations cached per page URL for 24 hours
- **Seamless timing**: Translation completes during breathing phase
- **No blocking**: Errors don't break the flow

---

## Design Alignment

✅ **Calm by Default** - Subtle badge, not banner
✅ **Simplicity = Clarity** - Removes language barrier
✅ **Sensory Harmony** - Translates during breathing
✅ **Empathetic Accessibility** - Helps global users
✅ **Human Warmth** - Meets users in their language

## What's Next (Optional)

### Future Enhancements:

1. Manual translation option in "More" panel
2. Bilingual view for language learners
3. Translation toggle (show original)
4. Translate reflection prompts too
5. Settings UI for translation preferences

## Testing

### Manual Test:

1. Open a Spanish article
2. Click "Reflect"
3. Watch breathing phase
4. Summary should appear in English
5. Small badge should show "🌐 Spanish"

## Summary

Translation is now **seamlessly integrated** into your meditation flow:

- Happens during breathing (invisible to user)
- Shows subtly with small badge
- Respects zen aesthetic
- Makes Reflexa accessible to non-English speakers

**This is inclusive mindfulness done right.** 🌿
