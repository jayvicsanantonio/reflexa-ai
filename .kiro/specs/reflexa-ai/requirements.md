# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Reflexa AI is a wellness-centered Chrome Extension that transforms everyday reading into calm, reflective micro-sessions. The system helps users absorb more, stress less, and remember what matters through guided reflection, AI-powered summarization, and focus tracking â€” all powered by Chrome's Gemini Nano AI running locally on the user's device. The extension detects when users have been reading for a sustained period, gently invites them to reflect, generates actionable summaries, and stores reflections in a calming "Reflect Mode" interface with a Zen-inspired aesthetic.

## Glossary

- **Reflexa_System**: The complete Chrome Extension including all components (content script, background service worker, popup dashboard, and options page)
- **Gemini_Nano**: Chrome's built-in AI model that runs locally on the user's device for on-device inference
- **Reflect_Mode**: The full-screen overlay interface with breathing orb animation where users engage with summaries and write reflections
- **Content_Script**: The JavaScript code injected into web pages that monitors user behavior and injects the Reflect Mode UI
- **Background_Service_Worker**: The persistent background process that orchestrates AI calls, manages storage, and coordinates between components
- **Dwell_Time**: The duration in seconds that a user remains focused on a webpage before being prompted to reflect
- **Reflection**: A user-generated response to AI-generated prompts, stored with the page summary and metadata
- **Dashboard**: The popup interface accessible via the extension icon showing reflection history, streaks, and statistics
- **Breathing_Orb**: The animated circular visual element that expands and contracts in a 7-second cycle to promote calm focus
- **Three_Bullet_Summary**: The AI-generated summary format consisting of exactly three points: Insight, Surprise, and Apply

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a student, I want the extension to detect when I've been reading an article for a while, so that I can be gently reminded to reflect on what I've learned without interrupting my flow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user has been actively viewing a webpage for at least the configured dwell threshold seconds, THE Content_Script SHALL display a floating lotus icon nudge on the page.
2. WHILE the user is on a webpage, THE Content_Script SHALL track the user's dwell time by monitoring page visibility and user interaction events.
3. THE Content_Script SHALL extract the main readable content from the DOM by identifying article text and excluding navigation, advertisements, and sidebar elements.
4. WHERE the user has configured a custom dwell threshold in settings, THE Reflexa_System SHALL use that threshold value instead of the default value.
5. IF the user navigates away from the page before reaching the dwell threshold, THEN THE Content_Script SHALL reset the dwell timer to zero.

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a professional, I want to see a calming overlay with an AI-generated summary when I choose to reflect, so that I can quickly capture the key insights without feeling overwhelmed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks the lotus icon nudge, THE Content_Script SHALL inject the Reflect_Mode overlay into the current page.
2. THE Reflect_Mode SHALL display a Breathing_Orb that animates with a 7-second expansion and contraction cycle.
3. WHEN Reflect_Mode activates, THE Background_Service_Worker SHALL send the extracted page content to Gemini_Nano for summarization.

5. THE Reflect_Mode SHALL display the Three_Bullet_Summary with labels "Insight", "Surprise", and "Apply" within 4 seconds of activation.

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a mindfulness seeker, I want the reflection experience to include calming audio and smooth animations, so that the process feels meditative and restorative rather than like another productivity tool.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Reflect_Mode activates, THE Reflexa_System SHALL play a gentle entry chime sound lasting less than 1 second at 30% volume.
2. WHILE Reflect_Mode is active, THE Reflexa_System SHALL play an 8-second ambient hum audio loop at 30% volume.

4. WHERE the user has enabled the "Reduce Motion" setting, THE Reflexa_System SHALL disable the Breathing_Orb animation and gradient drift effects.
5. WHERE the user has disabled sound in settings, THE Reflexa_System SHALL not play any audio during Reflect_Mode.

### Requirement 4

5. THE Reflexa_System SHALL store the user's reflection answers along with the summary and page metadata when the user saves the reflection.

### Requirement 5

5. THE Dashboard SHALL display a privacy notice stating "Your reflections never leave your device" on first launch.

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want to control motion and sound settings, so that the extension works comfortably for my sensory preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Reflexa_System SHALL provide a settings toggle for "Reduce Motion" that disables all continuous animations.
2. THE Reflexa_System SHALL provide a settings toggle for "Enable Sound" that controls all audio playback.

4. THE Reflexa_System SHALL maintain color contrast ratios of at least 4.5:1 for all text elements to meet WCAG AA standards.
5. THE Reflexa_System SHALL support full keyboard navigation with Tab, Enter, and Escape keys across all interactive elements.

### Requirement 7
