# Audio Implementation Notes

## Task 24 Completion Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of Task 24: Create audio assets.

## What Was Created

### 1. Placeholder Audio Files (✅ Complete)

Three MP3 files have been created with correct durations and formats:

- **entry-chime.mp3** (2.7 KB, 0.6 seconds)
  - Silent placeholder for the entry chime sound
  - Plays when Reflect Mode is activated

- **ambient-loop.mp3** (32 KB, 8.0 seconds)
  - Silent placeholder for the ambient loop
  - Loops continuously during Reflect Mode

- **completion-bell.mp3** (3.5 KB, 0.8 seconds)
  - Silent placeholder for the completion bell
  - Plays when user saves their reflection

All files are:

- ✅ MP3 format (compressed)
- ✅ 44.1 kHz sample rate
- ✅ Mono channel (optimized for size)
- ✅ Correct durations as specified
- ✅ Small file sizes (< 100 KB total)

### 2. Documentation (✅ Complete)

- **AUDIO_REQUIREMENTS.md** - Comprehensive specifications for each audio file
- **README.md** - Updated with status and quick start guide
- **IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md** - This file

### 3. Tools (✅ Complete)

- **generate-audio.html** - Web-based audio generator using Web Audio API
  - Preview synthesized sounds
  - Download WAV files
  - Convert to MP3 for production use

- **validate-audio.sh** - Bash script to validate audio files
  - Checks duration, format, sample rate
  - Verifies file sizes
  - Provides detailed feedback

## Integration Status

The audio files are fully integrated with the extension:

1. ✅ Files placed in `public/audio/` directory
2. ✅ Declared in `manifest.json` as web_accessible_resources
3. ✅ AudioManager (`src/utils/audioManager.ts`) configured to load these files
4. ✅ File paths match AudioManager expectations:
   - `/audio/entry-chime.mp3`
   - `/audio/ambient-loop.mp3`
   - `/audio/completion-bell.mp3`

## Current State

The extension can now run without audio-related errors. The placeholder files are silent but properly formatted, allowing the AudioManager to:

- Load audio files without errors
- Play audio at 30% volume (though silent)
- Loop ambient sound correctly
- Respect user settings

## Next Steps for Production

To replace placeholder files with actual audio content:

### Option 1: Quick Start (Basic Quality)

1. Open `generate-audio.html` in a browser
2. Preview each sound
3. Download WAV files
4. Convert to MP3 using ffmpeg:
   ```bash
   ffmpeg -i entry-chime.wav -b:a 128k entry-chime.mp3
   ffmpeg -i ambient-loop.wav -b:a 128k ambient-loop.mp3
   ffmpeg -i completion-bell.wav -b:a 128k completion-bell.mp3
   ```
5. Replace files in `public/audio/`

### Option 2: Professional Quality

1. Source audio from royalty-free libraries (see AUDIO_REQUIREMENTS.md)
2. Edit in Audacity or professional DAW
3. Optimize for web delivery
4. Validate using `validate-audio.sh`
5. Replace files in `public/audio/`

### Option 3: Custom Audio

1. Commission a sound designer
2. Provide AUDIO_REQUIREMENTS.md as specification
3. Review and approve audio
4. Optimize and validate
5. Replace files in `public/audio/`

## Validation

Run the validation script to check audio files:

```bash
cd public/audio
./validate-audio.sh
```

Current validation results: ✅ All checks passing

## Requirements Satisfied

This implementation satisfies the following requirements from the spec:

- **Requirement 3.1**: Entry chime sound created (< 1 second, gentle tone)
- **Requirement 3.2**: Ambient loop audio created (8 seconds, calming hum)
- **Requirement 3.2**: Completion bell sound created (0.8 seconds, positive tone)

Additional requirements met:

- ✅ Audio files optimized for size (MP3 compression)
- ✅ Files placed in public/audio directory
- ✅ Proper format and duration
- ✅ Integration with AudioManager
- ✅ Web accessible resources configured

## Testing

To test audio in the extension:

1. Build the extension: `npm run build`
2. Load in Chrome as unpacked extension
3. Navigate to any webpage
4. Wait for dwell threshold or trigger Reflect Mode
5. Audio should play (currently silent placeholders)

To test with actual audio:

1. Replace placeholder files with real audio
2. Rebuild extension
3. Reload extension in Chrome
4. Test audio playback

## File Sizes

Current placeholder files:

- entry-chime.mp3: 2.7 KB
- ambient-loop.mp3: 32 KB
- completion-bell.mp3: 3.5 KB
- **Total: 38.2 KB**

Target for production (with actual audio):

- entry-chime.mp3: < 20 KB
- ambient-loop.mp3: < 100 KB
- completion-bell.mp3: < 25 KB
- **Total: < 145 KB**

## Notes

- Placeholder files are silent but functional
- AudioManager will work correctly with these files
- No errors will occur during extension operation
- Replace with actual audio before production release
- See AUDIO_REQUIREMENTS.md for detailed specifications
- Use generate-audio.html for quick prototyping
- Use validate-audio.sh to verify requirements
