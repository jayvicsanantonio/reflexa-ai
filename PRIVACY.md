# Reflexa AI – Privacy Policy

Last updated: 2025-11-01

- All AI processing happens on-device via Chrome Built‑in AI (Gemini Nano). No content is sent to external servers.
- The extension stores your reflections and settings in Chrome storage on your device. By default, data is kept locally.
- No analytics, tracking pixels, or third‑party SDKs are included.
- The extension requests site access solely to render the in‑page overlay and to extract the text you are viewing for on‑device summarization.

## Data we store locally
- Reflections you explicitly save (title, URL, timestamps, your notes, AI outputs)
- Settings and preferences (e.g., dwell threshold, motion/sound toggles)
- Basic usage counters kept on device for rate limiting and performance diagnostics

## Your choices
- You can export and delete your reflections in the popup.
- You can disable sound and motion under Settings.
- You can uninstall the extension at any time to remove its data.
